Installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Extract the "Loginxml" folder into the "../Runes of Magic/Interface" folder. It does NOT go into the addons folder. The resulting folder should look like this "../Runes of Magic/Interface/Loginxml".

2. Edit "accountlogin.lua" and add the account names, passwords, servers and labels you wish to use. There is a handy "button map" included to show you where the buttons will appear around the "Log In" button. If a buttons "UserName" equals "" and "Label" equals "" then that button will not be shown.

3. Edit "logindialog.lua" and add the corresponding secondary passwords. Make sure they match up with the account numbers in accountlogin.lua.

4. Restart the Runes of Magic client.

That's all you need to setup to use it for botting. You can change the settings at the top of "accountlogin.lua" to affect your manual play, they should not effect botting. The description is included with each option.
